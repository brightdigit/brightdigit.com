extension TailwindStyle {
  /// A fully-formed Tailwind utility class fragment — the whole `"bg-blue-500"`,
  /// `"flex"`, or `"md:hover:gap-4"` that ``TailwindStyle`` appends to its token
  /// list.
  ///
  /// `TailwindClass` is the **seam value** the public builder primitive
  /// ``TailwindStyle/appending(_:)`` accepts. It exists so the seam can be
  /// `public` (required for the capability-protocol architecture — see
  /// ``TailwindStyleProtocol``) *without* the public API ever accepting a raw
  /// `String`: the built-in utilities construct a ``TailwindStyle/DefaultTailwindClass``,
  /// whose initializer is `internal`, so a caller cannot mint one from an
  /// arbitrary string. This preserves TailwindKit's invariant that the modeled
  /// surface is closed and type-safe.
  ///
  /// Unlike ``TailwindToken`` (a *value fragment* like `blue`/`500`), a
  /// `TailwindClass` is an *entire* utility class. A downstream module can still
  /// conform its own type as a deliberate escape hatch, but the ordinary path is
  /// the leading-dot fluent members.

  ///
  /// A `public` type (it is the concrete value the capability witnesses pass to
  /// the seam) with an `internal` initializer, so it is **not constructible by
  /// name** outside the module — like ``TailwindStyle/DefaultColor``. This is
  /// what keeps the public seam from becoming a raw-string entry point.
